# EXAMPLE: ./run_c.sh closestSubsetSum.c

# Set the name for the final executable
EXECUTABLE_NAME="my_program_exec"

# --- CHECK FOR INPUT FILE ---

# If you need external libraries (like -lm for math functions), you can add
# them here.
# Note: The $UTILITY_FILES variable will be expanded by the shell to the list of found files.
